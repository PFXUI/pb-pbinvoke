<h1>Unsupported and unimplemented PBInvoke features</h1>


<h2> Unsupported usage of PBInvoke </h2>
The following modes may (or may not) work but are not supported officially.
<li> Using PBInvoke with PowerBuilder 5 (PBInvoke supports only PB 6 and above)
<li> Machine code targets (DLL builds) 
<li> Web and .Net targets (WinForm, WebForm, JSP, Web services ...)

<p> Only P-code (PBD) builds are supported.

<h2> Unimplemented features</h2>

The following features will be implemented in one of the future versions of PBInvoke.

<li> .Net interop (calls to external .Net classes, not under .Net targets)
<li> Java interop (calls to external Java classes)
<li> Calls via function pointers (now only named DLL functions and PB callbacks can be called)
<li> Double, float as a return type for callbacks. However pointers to such types are supported as a return type. 
<li> Any struct of size of more than 4 bytes as a return type for any function. 
However pointers to such structures are supported as a return type. 
<li> C++ classes, structures inherited from other structures.
