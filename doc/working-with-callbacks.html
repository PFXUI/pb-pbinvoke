<h1>Working with callbacks</h1>

<p>PowerBuilder does not support PowerScript code to be directly called from external functions. 

<p>As of PB9 there is a possibility to write a C++ extension for that task using PBNI. 
However, implementing callbacks using PBNI has the following limitations:
<li> PBNI requires knowledge of C++ from PowerBuilder developer  
<li> PBNI extensions are quite hard to write and debug.
<li> PBNI requires separate DLLs for ANSI and Unicode versions.
<li> PBNI is available only as of PB9.
<p>Also, there are additional limitations not related to PBNI.
<li> It's hard to implement (even in C++) passing of context data to the callback if the caller does not support that. 
<li> A charset conversion is needed when the caller is ANSI and PB is Unicode and vice versa. 

<p> PBInvoke has support for declaring and using callbacks directly in PowerScript code 
without these limitations. 

<h2>Callback declaration</h2>
<p> In order to declare a callback you need the following steps:
<li>Inherit a custom class from n_pi_method
<li>In the <code>constructor</code> event, call <code>of_declare_callback()</code> with a callback type declaration 
or a type name (in case the type was declared earlier).
<li>Extend the <code>ue_callback</code> event

<p>Example:
<pb>
// in n_cst_timerproc's constructor (inherited from n_pi_method)
n_pi_core lnv_core

lnv_core.of_declare("&
typedef VOID CALLBACK TimerProc(&
    HWND hwnd, &
    UINT uMsg, &
    UINT_PTR idEvent, &
    DWORD dwTime &
);&
")

of_declare_callback("TimerProc")

</pb>

<h2>Getting callback address</h2>
Use <code>n_pi_method.of_get_addr()</code> to get the numeric value of the callback address ready to be passed to 
an external function which accepts function pointers of this type.

<p>Example:
<pb>
n_cst_timerproc lnv_timerproc 
lnv_timerproc = Create n_cst_timerproc

// ef_SetTimer is an external function, alias for WinAPI SetTimer
ll_timer = ef_SetTimer(0, 0, 1000, lnv_timerproc.of_get_addr()) 
</pb>


<h2>Accessing callback parameters and returning result</h2>

<p>In the <code>ue_callback</code> event, callback parameters can be retrieved by 
calling <code>of_get_param("<i>paramname</i>")</code>.

<p>The return value is passed to the caller of the callback using usual RETURN operator.
Note, that PBInvoke does not support the following types as return types of callbacks:
<li> float(real), double
<li> longlong
<li> structs/unions of size of more than 4 bytes
<p>However, pointers or references to those type are supported.

<p>Example:
<pb>ulong hwnd
ulong uMsg
ulong idEvent
ulong dwTime

// retrieve parameters
hwnd = of_get_param("hwnd")
uMsg = of_get_param("uMsg")
idEvent = of_get_param("idEvent")
dwTime = of_get_param("dwTime")

// process event
...

Return 0
</pb>

<h2>Callback context data</h2>
<p>All context data needed by a callback can be stored in the instance variables of the callback object 
(which is a descendant of n_pi_method).
<p>That is possible because PBInvoke generates a unique phisical address (function pointer) for
each callback object, and when an external function calls your callback via that address, PBInvoke maps that call
exactly to your object.


<h2>Performance of callbacks</h2>
<p>Marshalling parameters between C++ and PB is a slow operation (compared to PB external functions calls) due to
the flexibility PBInvoke provides. If a PB callback is used as a handler for intercepting GUI messages 
(e.g. via calling <code>SetWindowsHookEx</code>), then it may cause slow repaint of UI, or even a hang for a long time, 
because UI generates huge amount of messages, most of which are ignored by the callback but take time for marshalling.

<p>PBInvoke provides an optimization for that case. For callbacks used with <code>SetWindowsHookEx</code> WinAPI
function, it's possible to setup a filter for message ID's which are processed by the callback.
If a message ID does not pass the filter, the PowerScript code of the callback will not be called and all the processing
will be done in C++ according to the rules described in MSDN for <code>SetWindowsHookEx</code> hooks: call 
<code>CallNextHookEx</code>.
<p>In order to activate the message filter you must call <code>of_set_windows_hook_filter()</code> immediately
after calling <code>SetWindowsHookEx()</code>.
<p> Syntax: <blockquote>
 <code>
 <i>callback</i>.of_set_windows_hook_filter(<i>hook_handle</i>, <i>hook_type</i>,  <i>message_id_array[]</i>)
 </code>
 <p>where
 <li> <i>callback</i> - callback object
 <li> <i>hook_handle</i> - hook handle returned by SetWindowsHookEx()
 <li> <i>hook_type</i> - one of supported by PBInvoke hook types (WH_CALLWNDPROCRET, WH_CALLWNDPROC, WH_GETMESSAGE)
 <li> <i>message_id_array[]</i> - array of long integers filled with accepted message ID's
</blockquote>

<p>Example:
<pb>// This code is part of CustomSaveAs sample, which demonstrates 
// using callbacks for customizing Windows Shell 'Save As' dialog.
Long ll_hInstance, ll_hThreadID

ll_hInstance = inv_GetWindowLong.of_invoke(al_windowhandle, n_pi_winapi.GWL_HINSTANCE)
ll_hThreadID = inv_GetCurrentThreadId.of_invoke()

il_hHook = inv_SetWindowsHookEx.of_invoke(n_pi_winapi.WH_CALLWNDPROCRET, this.of_get_addr(), ll_hInstance, ll_hThreadID)

// IMPORTANT! As number of messages sent to UI related windows hooks is really huge, 
// processing them all in PowerScript is inefficient, and probably will hang the UI.
// PBInvoke can efficiently filter hook messages by message id.
// The following call enables this feature.
// of_set_windows_hook_filter must be called immediately after SetWindowsHookEx()
// The args: hook handle, hook type, and array of message ids which pass via filter to the hook.
of_set_windows_hook_filter(il_hHook, n_pi_winapi.WH_CALLWNDPROCRET, &
	{n_pi_winapi.CB_ADDSTRING, n_pi_winapi.CB_SETCURSEL} )

// Currently only WH_CALLWNDPROCRET, WH_CALLWNDPROC, WH_GETMESSAGE hook types are 
// supported with this filtering feature
